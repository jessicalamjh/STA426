## Introduction

In this homework, we will sample 100 values from the LogNormal distribution with $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = 0.25$. We have set a seed for reproducibility.

```{r}
set.seed(2)
x <- rlnorm(n = 100, meanlog = 0, sdlog = .25)
```

## Visualisation

Below is the histogram of sampled values. The sample mean is `r mean(x)` and the sample variance is `r var(x)`.

```{r}
hist(x,
    main = "Histogram of 100 values from LN(1,0.25)",
    xlab = "x",
    ylab = "Frequency",
    xlim = c(0, 2),
    ylim = c(0, 30),
    col = "#7e4d7e"
)
```
